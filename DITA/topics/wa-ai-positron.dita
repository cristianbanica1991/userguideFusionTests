      our <xref href="https://www.oxygenxml.com/oxygen-xml-web-author/" format="html"
        scope="external">online demo website</xref> provides various ways to use ChatGPT while

      <title>Using the AI Positron Assistant Pane</title>
      <p id="p_hbd_kdr_1zb">When you first open the pane, you need to use the
          <uicontrol>Connect</uicontrol> button to sign in. A user drop-down menu will be available
        in the top-right corner of the view. This drop-down contains an option to view your
          <uicontrol>Usage status</uicontrol> (see <xref href="#wa-ai-positron/section_enw_lnb_4yb"
          >AI Server Requests and Credits</xref>) and an action to <uicontrol>Disconnect</uicontrol>
        from the service.</p>

    <p id="p_f5m_rcr_1zb">The <xref href="#wa-ai-positron/section_lf1_vkz_qlb">AI actions that are
        available</xref> can be found in the <uicontrol>Actions</uicontrol> drop-down menu at the
      top of the pane. When an action is triggered, the main box within the pane presents the
      response from the server based on the particular action.</p>
    <p id="p_a2c_42r_1zb">The response is received from the server in streaming mode (the AI sends
      chunks of the response as it is being generated rather than waiting to send the entire
      response after it is generated). Once the entire response is received from the server, the
      following actions are available under the response:<ul id="ul_b2c_42r_1zb">
        <li id="li_c2c_42r_1zb"><b>Insert/Replace</b> - Inserts the response at the cursor location
          within the document (or replaces the selected content).</li>
        <li id="li_d2c_42r_1zb"><b>Preview</b> - Allows you to preview the content that would be
          inserted at the cursor location within the document. This opens a file comparison where
          you can clearly see the changes that the AI suggested and if you agree with the changes,
          you can click the <uicontrol>Apply</uicontrol> button at the bottom of the comparison tool
          to insert the response at the cursor location.</li>
        <li id="li_e2c_42r_1zb"><b>Copy</b> - Copies the response to the system clipboard.</li>
      </ul></p>
    <p id="p_hzh_dtv_4xb">To clear the information, click the <uicontrol><image
          href="../img/ai-Chat16.png"/>New Chat</uicontrol> button in the top-right corner of the
      view. You can also use the <uicontrol><image href="../img/ai-history-drop.png"
        />History</uicontrol> drop-down toolbar button to select and continue previous conversations
      or actions.</p>
    <p id="p_gjr_s2r_1zb">You can use the bottom box to refine the response by sending a message to
      the AI platform and it will generate a new response based upon your message.</p>

        server each month and this is managed through the use of credits. Each user has a default
        limit of 100,000 credits per month.</p>

      <p id="p_nv2_t4b_4yb">Each invoked action consumes tokens with the AI prompt associated with
        the action, the input text (editor text, selection from the editor text, chat messages, or
        user input), and the AI response. After these, the tokens are converted to credits according
