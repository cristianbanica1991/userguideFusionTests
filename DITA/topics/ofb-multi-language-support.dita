    <body>
    <p>The language that the search engine will use for the indexing process is configurable. There
      are numerous different languages to choose from. <b>Oxygen Feedback</b> uses language-specific
      rules when analyzes the indexed content.</p>
    <p>The language can be configured from the <xref
        href="ofb-version-management.dita#ofb-version-management/content-indexing-search"><i>Content
          Indexing and Search</i></xref> section that is available in the <i>Version Settings</i>
      page.</p>
    <note id="note_wnw_x5n_zyb">If the indexing language is changed, the current index is dropped
      and a new indexing task is started. </note>
