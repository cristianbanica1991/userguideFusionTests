    <title>Content Indexing</title>
    <body>
      <p>To configure <ph keyref="product"/> as an external search engine in <b>Oxygen WebHelp
        Responsive</b> output, you must activate the indexing functionality in the current version
      of the particular site configuration.<note id="note_ed3_3sn_zyb"> This functionality requires
        the output to be generated using <b>Oxygen WebHelp</b> version 25 or later. </note></p>
    <p>The content indexing plays a critical role in the search process by serving as a map or guide
      that enables <b>Oxygen Feedback</b> to quickly and efficiently locate relevant content based
      on user queries. When <b>Oxygen Feedback</b> crawls the WebHelp Responsive output, it indexes
      the content of each page creating a searchable record of the HTML content.</p>
    <p>The index stores information about the content of each page, including the text and the page
      title, as well as metadata such as keywords, index terms and description. </p>
    <p>The content indexing functionality can be enabled from the <xref
        href="ofb-version-management.dita#ofb-version-management/content-indexing-search"><i>Content
          Indexing and Search</i></xref> section that is available in the <i>Version Settings</i>
        page.<note id="note_jxf_cvn_zyb" type="important"><b>Oxygen Feedback</b> indexes the HTML
        content available at the Base URL of the current site configuration version.</note></p>
