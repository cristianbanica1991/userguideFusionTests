    <p>The <b>Oxygen Feedback</b> search engine supports facets and faceted search functionality.
      Facets are predefined categories that are associated with search results. Users can select one
      or more of these facets when searching WebHelp output to narrow down their search results to a
      specific category or set of categories, and the search engine will only display results that
      match all the selected facets.</p>
